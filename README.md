# Open-Air Acoustic Delay-line Memory using a uC

![Assembled prototype board used for the experiment](https://github.com/mickymuis/delayline/blob/master/images/assembled.jpg "Assembled prototype")

This project tries to reconstruct [Delay Line Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_line_memory) using a micro-controller (e.g. Arduino). Main inspriration is drawn from the work by [Joseph Allen](http://jhallenworld.blogspot.nl/2014/01/acoustic-delay-line-memory.html) and [Stephen Cass](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-a-delayline-memory-out-of-mostly-thin-air). If you want more theoretical information about delay lines, I recommend reading [1] by Auerbach and of course my own essay that you can find in the ```essay/``` folder of this repository.
